# YP3 V0.1
A youtube to mp3 converter without the hassle!

This GUI program lets you input names of songs into text boxes and a directory. Once both are filled in, the program will grab the songs you wrote and download them into the given directory.
You can put as many lines of text as you want and it will search through all of them, so go wild.

I will try to update this program as much as possible to make it the best it can be.

Will update here when the new stuff happens.

The downloadable exe file will come when I feel like the program is ready, thank you!
